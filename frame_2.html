        <h1>Why I want to be a devloper</h1> 
        <p>There are multiple reaosons which are pulling me towards developing tech</p>
        <p>I am working in corporate API team surrounded by excellent engineers, this has inspired me</p> 
        <p>Pandemic made me realise that it is technology powered by APIs that has kept us all connected and sane during diffcult lockdown period</p>
        <p>After working in API banking space for 6+ years, API development is the only part left to be mastered in API lifecycle</p>
        <p>DB has provided the great opportunity fill this gap and also to align with Engineering culture</p>
        <p>I have been a developer in Retail Banking Product space years ago, that had exposed me to Sybase, C, Unix</p>
